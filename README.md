# Advanced_Data_Science_with_IBM_Final_Project

This is the final advanced data science capstone project of the course "Advanced Data Science", offered by COURSERA.

This capstone project needed to be submitted in order to gain the specialization certificate "IBM Data Sciene".

The final task was to find an open source data set about a topic that fits to each person. I decided to evaluate some quality data about red whine, since I'm living in rhineland palatinate, which is known for its booming whine sector.

Libraries used: Pandas, Folium, Numpy, BeautifulSoup, Geocoder, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Statistics.

Machine learning algorithms used: RandomForest algorithm, DecisionTree algorithm, LogisticRegression algorithm, KNeighbors algorithm

Scaler used: Normalizer, MaxAbsScaler, MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, RobustScaler

The project was written in a Jupyter notebook, which can be used to show the code and the output simultaneously.
